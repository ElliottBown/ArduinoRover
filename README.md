# ArduinoRover
The code for my Arduino rover project.

PHYSICAL DESIGN
---------------
The physical design for the rover was an arduino on a board with a wheel either side and auxillary components, of which included:
- Infared Sensors
- 1 LDR
- 2 buttons
- 3 LEDs
- 2 Step motors

GOAL
----
The goal of this project was to move the rover through a maze, which consited of black lines printed onto A4 sheets of paper. The rover was not allowed to drive over the lines normally. There were 'obstacles' however, which consisted of thinner horisontal lines over the drive space where the rover would have to stop for a couple seconds and show a sign of recognition before continuing.
